      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hi! My name is Dylan Adams and currently enrolled in my final semester
        as a student at RMIT. My student number is s3849200 & you can contact me
        at s3849200@student.rmit.edu.au. I am born and raised in Eastern
        Melbourne Australia where I have undertaken my high school studies at
        St. Josephs College Ferntree Gully. I am also involved in a local
        football team (Upper Ferntree Gully) where I spend most of my Saturday’s
        playing & supporting the club. I also have 2 dogs, one named Spud who is
        14 and is a border collie. My other dog is named Letty who is only 6
        months old and a new addition of my family. <br />
        <br />
        My interest in IT first sparked when I got my very first iPod touch in
        grade 4. It was around the time of the iPhone launch I became obsessed
        with apple and how their products were so advanced compared to their
        competitors. I also gained interested in gaming along my journey in
        which I built my own PC. The way I learned to do this was by watching
        endless hours on YouTube of how it was done as I found the whole process
        interesting. In terms of technology now I run apple an MacBook, iPhone,
        apple watch & air pods as they all work seamlessly together. This for me
        helps increase productivity and removes any headache I may run into
        elsewise. I also use a dedicated windows PC for gaming as it is better
        optimised. <br />
        <br />

        RMIT was a suitable choice for me as they offered the course of
        accounting which was my chosen path on completing year 12. In comparison
        to other Universities, it is easily accessible by catching a train
        straight to Melbourne Central which eliminates having to drive. This in
        hindsight is cheaper as I don’t have spent money on petrol and parking.
        Another reason was the way classes were run. They are interactive and
        fun which enhances my ability to learn throughout my studies. <br />
        <br />
        As I am now in my final semester, I have learned many things business
        related to which I hope will help me in the real world. I have learned
        how businesses operate from a financial standpoint to other
        miscellaneous subjects such as the inner outs of cryptocurrency to
        coding in Python. These electives will hopefully benefit me in my career
        in the hopes to have a financially stable future.

        The position available at ID Digital Agency is appealing to me as it is
        targeting some of skills that I am learning. These are JavaScript, HTML,
        CSS, React & Next.js which abased of research I have found to be the
        most popular skills in software development. The role also has next.js
        in its required set of skills which I do not have. My guess is that
        next.js is similar to react & node being an extended framework for
        JavaScript. The experience required is 4+ years which I do not currently
        have however it is a role I would consider when the time comes. My
        current skills that I can apply are HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and
        fundamentals for React. <br />
        <br />
        me to be able to obtain all skills on the list I will continue to learn
        whether that is through my course this semester or YouTube. I will also
        apply my skills by creating projects so that I can get firsthand
        experience to show the employer that I am willing to learn outside of
        school. This shows passion in what I am doing which will lead to me
        putting more effort and taking pride in my work.

      The results below indicate to me that I am a very laid-back character
      although when work needs to be done, I will not stop until it is complete.
      I discovered I am both introvert and extravert in the sense that I like
      attention however will not go out of my way for it. This means that I know
      when and when not to speak up which is a positive trait to take into a
      team. I understand what is going on around me very well which is good for
      identifying key problems within a team. This means that I should observe
      carefully who I chose for a team however I personally believe I should be
      open to work with everyone and treat it as an experience as there will be
      times in my life where I will not have a choice.

        The idea that I have thought of is a contact tracing Sherrin football.
        There will be a sensor that will log where on the ball it has made
        contact with the foot or hand. This will allow for people to gain an
        understanding of how the ball is being kicked and handballed. This could
        be beneficial for AFL players as it will show the average point made
        contact which could help each team improve their skill sets allowing
        them to be more competitive. It can also be used as a training method
        for new players who want to improve at the sport.
        <br />
        <br />
        Motivation for this product was inspired by the Mark Williams Sherrin
        Football. This yellow football has a visible red spin line included to
        help kick the footy correctly which enhances the player to kick better.
        It is used by AFL clubs Richmond & Western bull dogs already which
        indicates its success. As someone who plays footy, I feel like this
        product would benefit my skills as a player. A Footy with a chip inside
        of it would give you even further feedback with a technology element
        enabling it to log even more precise.
